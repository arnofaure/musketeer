    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <p class="quizz">Does it work with adaptative websites?</p>
    <p class="answer">No, only with fresh new responsive ones.</p>
    <p class="quizz">Is it 100% accurate?</p>
    <p class="answer">No, it's not. Use it at as a preview, to take a screenshot or to show to your client, but it's not a tool for debugging.</p>
    <p class="quizz">Could I share the preview with others?</p>
    <p class="answer">Yes, you can! Just copy the address and send it to whoever you want. They will see directly your amazing website on all the devices.</p>
		<p class="quizz">Why some websites doesn't show on Musketeer?</p>
		<p class="answer">Some websites won't show because the X-FRAME-OPTION is set to SAME ORIGIN. In other words, these sites use the X-FRAME-OPTION for security reason, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites. And Musketeer can't do anything in its end.</p>
    <p class="quizz">Who created this amazing tool?</p>
    <p class="answer">"Musketeer" was made by <a href="https://studionora.ca" target="_blank">Arno Faure / NÃ˜RA</a> based on the great work/website "Am I Responsive" by <a href="https://twitter.com/justinavery" target="_blank">Justin Avery</a>.</p>
		<p class="quizz">How can I create an animated gif?</p>
    <p class="answer">You've got plenty of great options to create a gif for your animated screenshots: <a href="https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture" target="_blank">GIPHY Capture</a>, <a href="http://www.cockos.com/licecap/" target="_blank">LICEcap</a>, etc.</p>
		<p class="quizz">Can I fork "Musketeer" on github?</p>
		<p class="answer">Yes you can, here is the link: <a href="https://github.com/arnofaure/musketeer" target="_blank">click me!</a></p>
		<p class="quizz">Why "Musketeer"?</p>
		<p class="answer">Ok, it's hard to find a good name for a tool! As I like D'Artagnan, Athos, Aramis and Porthos, and their motto: "All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall." I thought "Musketeer" would be a good fit!</p>
