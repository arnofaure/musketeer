# Musketeer V2
A simple tool to see how your site looks on desktop, laptop, tablet &amp; mobile.

**NEW**: Now you can display only the device you like

Just enter the website address with http(s)//... and click or press "Enter" and be :)

This tool is based on the work of [Justin Avery](https://github.com/justincavery/am-i-responsive)

*For Firefox users: I've got some issue with the "display only" feature. I will try to resolve this issue soon
